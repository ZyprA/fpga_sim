# FPGA Simulation of Full Components for Verilog

## Introduction
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are widely used in digital circuit design, allowing developers to implement and test hardware components in a flexible and reprogrammable manner. Verilog HDL is one of the most commonly used hardware description languages for FPGA development. However, setting up an FPGA simulation environment can be challenging, especially across different operating systems.

This repository provides a collection of reusable Verilog HDL components that can be simulated and tested on macOS, Windows, and Linux through a virtual machine. It aims to assist FPGA developers in prototyping, learning, and experimenting with Verilog HDL.

## Features
- **Full Component Simulation**: Includes arithmetic units, memory modules, state machines, and communication interfaces.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux using a virtual machine.
- **Open-Source and Free for Non-Commercial Use**: Encourages collaboration and knowledge sharing.
- **Ease of Use**: Pre-built Verilog components with documentation and example projects.

## Benefits
### üöÄ Accelerated Development Process
- Reuse pre-tested Verilog components to reduce development time.

### üéì Improved Learning Experience
- Great resource for students and beginners in FPGA design.

### üîÑ Cross-Platform Flexibility
- Works in a virtual machine, ensuring a consistent development environment.

### üõ†Ô∏è Reduction in Debugging Time
- Includes testbenches and simulation files for error detection.

## Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ZyprA/fpga_sim/fpga_sim.git
$ cd fpga_sim
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Machine
- Install **VirtualBox** or **VMware**
